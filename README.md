# Divar-Posts-Classification

In this project, we are going to use Naive Bayes Classifier to analyze the [Divar](https://divar.ir/s/tehran) posts, categorize them and try to predict the category using the data we have about the title and description of each post. we are given two sets of data which are extracted from the Divar website and we should classify the test data which consists of the title and the description of an advertisement into 6 classes: 

  1. vehicles 
  2. personal 
  3. businesses 
  4. for-the-home 
  5. leisure-hobbies 
  6. electronic-devices. 

**Naive bayes** is a classification technique based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
